  <h2>Automotive cabin filters</H2>
  <p>
    The <strong>cabin air filter</strong> is typically a pleated-paper filter that is placed in the outside-air intake for the vehicle's passenger compartment. Some of these filters are rectangular and similar in shape to the combustion air filter. Others are uniquely shaped to fit the available space of particular vehicles' outside-air intakes.

  </p><p style="margin-top:20px">Being a relatively recent addition to automobile equipment, this filter is often overlooked. Clogged or dirty cabin air filters can significantly reduce airflow from the cabin vents, as well as introduce allergens into the cabin air stream, and since the cabin air temperature depends upon the flow rate of the air passing through the heater core, the evaporator or both, they can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle's air conditioning and the heating performance. The poor performance of these filters is obscured by manufacturers by not using the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating system. Some people mistakenly believe that some of these are HEPA filters.
